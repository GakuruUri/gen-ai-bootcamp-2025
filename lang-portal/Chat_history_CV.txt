I need to implement an API backend. I have a detailed tech spec here: @backend-technical-specs.md 
can you please read it and give a summary of what you plan to do, and then we can proceed to build the
app in the backend_go directory.

I'll read the technical specifications and provide a summary of the implementation plan. Let me check the contents of the file first.

Analyzed

backend-technical-specs.md:(1-200)
Based on the technical specifications, I'll provide a summary of the implementation plan for the backend API. Here's what we need to build:

Project Setup
Create a Go project in the backend_go directory
Set up Gin framework for the API
Configure SQLite database
Set up Mage as the task runner
Database Implementation
Create SQLite database words.db with the following tables:
words (vocabulary storage)
word_groups (many-to-many relationship table)
groups (thematic word groups)
study_sessions (study session records)
study_activities (study activity records)
word_reviews_items (practice records)
API Endpoints Implementation
Dashboard endpoints:
/api/dashboard/last_study_session
/api/dashboard/study_progress
/api/dashboard/quick_stats
Study activities endpoints:
/api/study_activities/:id
/api/study-activities/:id/study_sessions
POST /api/study_activities
Words endpoints:
GET /api/words (with pagination)
GET /api/words/:id
Key Features
JSON responses for all endpoints
Pagination support where specified
No authentication/authorization (single user system)
Statistics tracking for study sessions
Word inventory management
Let me first check if the backend_go directory exists and create it if needed.

Great, the backend_go directory exists. Would you like me to proceed with setting up the project structure and implementing the components? I'll start with:

Setting up the Go module and project structure
Creating the database schema
Implementing the core models
Setting up the Gin router and API endpoints
Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with this plan or if you have any specific component you'd like me to focus on first.

lets implement this.

I'll start implementing the project. First, let's check if we have any existing files in the backend_go directory to ensure we don't overwrite anything.

I've set up the basic structure of our backend application. Here's what I've created:

go.mod - Module definition with required dependencies
main.go - Main application file with router setup and endpoint handlers
db/schema.sql - Database schema with all required tables
models/models.go - Data models matching our database schema and API responses
Before we can run the application, you'll need to:

Install Go on your system. You can do this with:
bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
sudo apt install golang-go
After installing Go, we'll need to:
Initialize the database
Install the project dependencies
Implement the handler functions
Set up the database operations
Would you like me to continue with implementing any specific part, or would you like to install Go first?

Great! I've completed the implementation of our backend API. Here's what we've done:

Set up the project structure with:
main.go - Main application with API routes and handlers
db/schema.sql - Database schema
db/db.go - Database operations
models/models.go - Data models
Implemented all required API endpoints:
/api/dashboard/last_study_session
/api/dashboard/study_progress
/api/dashboard/quick_stats
/api/study_activities/:id
/api/study-activities/:id/study_sessions
/api/words
/api/words/:id
Set up the SQLite database with all required tables:
words
groups
word_groups
study_activities
study_sessions
word_reviews_items
The server is now running on http://localhost:8080. You can test the API endpoints using tools like curl or Postman. For example:

bash
CopyInsert
curl http://localhost:8080/api/dashboard/quick_stats
curl http://localhost:8080/api/words
Would you like me to:

Add some sample data to the database for testing?
Implement any additional features or endpoints?
Add more error handling or validation?
Create API documentation?
Let me know what you'd like to focus on next!

Great! The API is working perfectly. Let me explain what we're seeing:

Quick Stats shows:
71.43% success rate (5 correct answers out of 7 attempts)
6 total study sessions
3 active groups
3 days streak
Words List shows:
All vocabulary items with their Japanese, romaji, and English translations
JSON metadata in the "parts" field
Proper pagination information
Single Word (ID: 1) shows:
Complete word information for "こんにちは" (konnichiwa)
Includes metadata about the word type and formality
Study Progress shows:
7 words have been studied
14 total words available in the system
Last Study Session shows:
Most recent session was in the "Colors" group
Includes session ID, group ID, and timestamp
All endpoints are responding correctly with proper JSON formatting and expected data. The server is running smoothly and handling requests as designed. Would you like to test any other endpoints or specific functionality?

How do i download the above chat in a .txt document?

I apologize, but I don't have direct access to functionality for downloading chat history. However, you can:

Use the Windsurf IDE's built-in features to save the chat history - there should be options in the IDE interface to export or save the conversation.
Alternatively, you can manually copy and paste the entire chat into a text file:

I've created a basic summary of our chat in chat_history.txt in your project directory. However, this is just a summary - for the complete chat history with all details and code snippets, I recommend using your IDE's built-in chat export functionality.

Give me clear directions on downloading the chat history on ide built-in chat export

I apologize, but I don't have access to information about the specific UI elements and export functionality of the Windsurf IDE. The best way to get accurate instructions would be to:

Look for an "Export" or "Download" button in the chat interface
Check the IDE's menu options for chat-related functions
Consult the IDE's documentation or help menu
Contact the Windsurf IDE support team for specific guidance
If you can't find these options, you might want to reach out to the Codeium team directly for assistance with the chat export functionality in their Windsurf IDE.
