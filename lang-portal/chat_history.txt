This document contains the implementation of a language learning portal backend API using Go, Gin, and SQLite. Here's what we accomplished:

1. Project Setup

2. Database Schema
Created tables for:
- words (vocabulary storage)
- word_groups (many-to-many relationships)
- groups (thematic word groups)
- study_sessions (study records)
- study_activities (activity records)
- word_reviews_items (practice records)

3. API Endpoints
Implemented:
- /api/dashboard/last_study_session
- /api/dashboard/study_progress
- /api/dashboard/quick_stats
- /api/study_activities/:id
- /api/study-activities/:id/study_sessions
- /api/words
- /api/words/:id

4. Testing Results
All endpoints tested successfully:
- Quick Stats: 71.43% success rate, 6 sessions, 3 active groups
- Words List: Successfully retrieving all vocabulary items
- Single Word: Detailed word information with metadata
- Study Progress: 7 words studied out of 14 total

The backend is fully functional and ready for integration with the frontend.
