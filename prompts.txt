1. I need to build an API for our lang portal app. All required tech specs are in the @Backend-Technical-Specs..md, 
give me a summary of what you plan to do, and then when we agree you can go ahead and execute the command to create the project.

2. Ensure the seeds data is available.

3. Can we group together the seeds and directories together in a folder called db.

4. Please proceed and build the app in the backend_go directory.
