### Sentence Structure  

- [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?  
- [Subject] [Verb] [Location].  

---

### Clues and Considerations  

- The first sentence is a question about whether something was seen, so you need to use the correct past tense form of “to see.”  
- The subject (raven) appears as the object of the first sentence.  
- The second sentence describes an action (looking) happening in a location (garden).  
- The verb for “to look at” is the same as “to see,” but you need to use it correctly in this context.  
- The phrase "our garden" requires the correct possessive form.  

Your turn! Try forming the sentence.

### Sentence Structure  

- [Subject] [Adjective] [Adjective] [Verb-past] [Object].

### Clues and Considerations  

- The subject (fox) has two adjectives describing it, so you need to know how to correctly order and connect them.  
- The verb "to jump" should be in the past tense.  
- The phrase "over the lazy dog" requires the correct verb and structure to indicate motion over something.  
- "Lazy dog" should be structured correctly to modify "dog" with "lazy."
