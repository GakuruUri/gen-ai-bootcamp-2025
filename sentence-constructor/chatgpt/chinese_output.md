### Clues and Considerations  

- The first sentence is a question, so you need the correct way to form a yes/no question.  
- "That" in "Did you see that?" functions as a demonstrative pronoun.  
- The second sentence describes an action in the past, so "to jump" needs to be in the correct past form.  
- "The quick brown fox" has two adjectives; make sure to order them correctly before the noun.  
- "Over the lazy dog" requires the correct structure for movement over something.  

Your turn! Try forming the sentence.

### Sentence Structure  

- [Subject] [Adverb] [Adjective] [Time] [Question]?  
- [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Question]?

### Clues and Considerations  

- The phrase “has been so hot lately” implies an ongoing action, so you need to use the correct adverb to express continuity.  
- “Lately” should come at the right position in the sentence to sound natural in Chinese.  
- The second sentence is a yes/no question, so it should be structured correctly with “this is” at the beginning.  
- “Golden age” is a phrase that already exists in Chinese, so you don’t need to translate it word by word.  
- The subject in the second sentence could either be explicitly stated (“this”) or implied based on context.
